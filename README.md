## AirBeats :musical_note:
A standalone musical instrument embedded in a glove. The motion data from movements of fingers is collected using flex sensors. This data is processed onboard using an Arduino Lilypad to produce different musical tones with the help of a tiny speaker. The device is powered by a battery and thus offers portability.

## LibBot :robot:
An assistant to help you choose books in the library. It is a small bot developed using Arduino Uno which moves on gear tracks, detects book tags and pops out relevant books from the rack.
